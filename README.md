# Purpose of the Project 
The Hammer Whack Game is a simple and interactive web-based game where players control a hammer to "whack" objects (or targets) on the screen.
The primary goal is to provide a fun and engaging game that can run smoothly on any modern web browser. 

Players can control the hammer's movement using their mouse and click to simulate the hammer strike, complete with sound effects. 
The game also includes pause and resume functionality, as well as background music with sound control options 

Run the Project;
- npm install 
- npm run start 

The project was a team effort with the following roles assigned:

- timerComponent.jsx

Esmatt:

Challenges the group agreed upon was learning to convert a larger pre-existing project and instead of the smaller ones we've created "ourselves".
